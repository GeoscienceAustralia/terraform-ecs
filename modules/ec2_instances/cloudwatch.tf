# Initialises cloudwatch logs

# Because alarms cost money we want to share them per log group. Therefore we want all environments in one log group. 
# For example: we have a CloudWatch LogGroup named 'docker' where you can find streams 'ENV/IP', like 'test/10.0.0.1'.  
# Consequence: When you have multiple ECS environments in one account you can only create the LogGroups once.
# This means that the other enviourments have to import the log groups.
# If you don't want that just specify the cloudwatch_prefix per enviourment.
